                <p>House Targaryen of Dragonstone is a noble family of Valyrian descent who once ruled the Seven
                    Kingdoms of
                    Westeros. The Targaryen sigil is a three-headed dragon breathing flames, red on black. The house
                    words
                    are
                    "Fire and Blood". It eventually became the first royal house of the Seven Kingdoms, as House
                    Targaryen
                    of
                    King's Landing.</p>

                    bleak collection of forbidding islands off the west coast of Westeros, from the Seastone Chair in

                    north.
                    In days of old they ruled as Kings of Winter, but since Aegon's Conquest they have been Wardens of
                    the North
                    and ruled as Lords of Winterfell. Their seat, Winterfell, is an ancient castle renowned for its
                    strength.
                    Their sigil is a grey direwolf racing across a field of white. Their words are "Winter is Coming",
                    one of
